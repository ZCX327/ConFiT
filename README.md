## 📌 Overview

This model decouples visual understanding into two complementary streams:

- **Spatial Branch**: Extracts appearance features from individual frames.
- **Temporal Branch**: Models motion and dynamics across time.

The two branches can be used independently or fused for joint spatio-temporal reasoning.

🔍 **Why partial release?**  
We open-source the core modeling components to support research reproducibility, while keeping internal data pipelines and full training infrastructure private.

📊 Dataset
The dataset will be publicly released soon.

For now, please contact the authors via email to request access.

We plan to upload the data to a public cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive / Baidu Netdisk) in the near future.
